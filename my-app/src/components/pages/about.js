          About Me
        </h1>

        <p>
          My name is Letania Ferreira and I am based in San Francisco.

          I love puzzles, languages, traveling, eating and cooking.

          In November 2017 I graduated from a womenâ€™s software engineering school, where I built Dining Hero and Language Learning.

          In September 2018 I wrapped up an internship at the Texas Advanced Computing Center, where I worked on DesignSafe, a natural hazard portal, which allows researchers to submit and check the results of jobs to supercomputers at the center. In my free time, I have been building websites, trying to learn new technologies and having some fun trying to solve code challenges. Please check my Github to see some of my projects. I am looking for cool oportunities in fullstack and backend development, specially if related to communication.

          Let's talk and thank you for visiting!
